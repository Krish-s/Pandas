# Pandas

Evalution of the train database in pandas.

Evaluation and Analysis of train dataset by droping columns, replacing values in columns, filling values in the Null values by calculating mean of the column and by other methods and by finding duplicates and droping duplicates .


The Numpy is studied and worked out . Generating random numbers , strings , and data distribution techniques are studied and worked out which inludes mean , standard deviation and variance and probability calculation.

The chi2 contigency, chi2 explanation which is done for category vs category is done and probability  and statistics , degrees of freedom values are calculated for the expected values with the observed values. The ttest is done for continuous vs continuous coulumns and the oneway test which is done for continuous vs category columns are evaluated successfully .
