# Pandas

Chennai store, sales,features datasets are imported from google drive and the three dataframes are merged on condition of same date and store columns.

Generation of apikey is done and pandas ai library is evaluated by importing SmartDataframe . The usage of promts to genrate the output values is successfull and the process of generation of the output values by giving the specific is later defiened clearly. I have learnt the usage of pandas ai in generating output for the give query and worked on entering specific prompts .

The Train dataset is taken and I understood the data which is the first process of data cleaning, followed by the rest of the data cleaning process. Then I checked for spelling mistakes and replaced with the correct values.This process of replacing is done by unique values in each columns and the data is checked for outliers and null . The null columns are edither dropped or replaced or filled by relating it with the rest of the non null columns.
Then I have dropped duplicates.Now this dataset is cleaned the process of data cleaning is compleated.

Now the correlation theory and the hypothis theory can be checked based on the requirements.

Data visualization is studied with plotyly express library as px. The dateset is loaded and it is visualized as bar,area,scatter,line graphs and the data is understood by visualisation using python.


Evalution of the train database in pandas.

Evaluation and Analysis of train dataset by droping columns, replacing values in columns, filling values in the Null values by calculating mean of the column and by other methods and by finding duplicates and droping duplicates .


The Numpy is studied and worked out . Generating random numbers , strings , and data distribution techniques are studied and worked out which inludes mean , standard deviation and variance and probability calculation.

The chi2 contigency, chi2 explanation which is done for category vs category is done and probability  and statistics , degrees of freedom values are calculated for the expected values with the observed values. The ttest is done for continuous vs continuous coulumns and the oneway test which is done for continuous vs category columns are evaluated successfully .

The chennai train dataset is analyed according to correleation theory and hypothesis theory and the result is evaluated successfully by comparing continuous vs continuous columns , continuous vs category columns , category vs category columns using two sample ttest ,oneway annova test and chi2 contigency test.
