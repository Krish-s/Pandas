# Pandas

Chennai store, sales,features datasets are imported from google drive and the three dataframes are merged on condition of same date and store columns.

Generation of apikey is done and pandas ai library is evaluated by importing SmartDataframe . The usage of promts to genrate the output values is successfull and the process of generation of the output values by giving the specific is later defiened clearly. I have learnt the usage of pandas ai in generating output for the give query and worked on entering specific prompts .

The Train dataset is taken and I understood the data which is the first process of data cleaning, followed by the rest of the data cleaning process. Then I checked for spelling mistakes and replaced with the correct values.This process of replacing is done by unique values in each columns and the data is checked for outliers and null . The null columns are edither dropped or replaced or filled by relating it with the rest of the non null columns.
Then I have dropped duplicates.Now this dataset is cleaned the process of data cleaning is compleated.

Now the correlation theory and the hypothis theory can be checked based on the requirements.

Data visualization is studied with plotyly express library as px. The dateset is loaded and it is visualized as bar,area,scatter,line graphs and the data is understood by visualisation using python.The values for x axis and y axis are given and the graph is visualized first and then topic for the graph is changed , hover_name given ,then animation_frame is used to animate the datset as per the requirement . 
Then bar polar graph is plotted by using radius and theta values from the dataset and the bar polar graph is visualized and understood successfully. To expolre 
the Exploitary Data Analysis installation of dataprep is done and create_report is imported and the dataframe df is passed in the create report . The whole dataframe which is passed in it is analysed completely and a overview or report of the df is given . This reoport show detailed analysis of the missing values,duplicates, Null values ,helps understanding the data easily and other details of the data so that it make it easy for the next process like data cleaning , and Machine Learning .

The distribution techniques like Uniform distribution , Binomial distribution, Normal distribution , Chi2 Contingency , Geometric distribution , Logistic distribution , Poisson Distribution , Exponential distribuion .

#skewness , kurtois

skewness and kurtosis are checked for the california housing train data and skewness and kurtosis is found in it . Then it's transformed from high skewed and kurtosis data to either no or moderately skewed an kustosis data .


Evalution of the train database in pandas.

Evaluation and Analysis of train dataset by droping columns, replacing values in columns, filling values in the Null values by calculating mean of the column and by other methods and by finding duplicates and droping duplicates .


The Numpy is studied and worked out . Generating random numbers , strings , and data distribution techniques are studied and worked out which inludes mean , standard deviation and variance and probability calculation.

The chi2 contigency, chi2 explanation which is done for category vs category is done and probability  and statistics , degrees of freedom values are calculated for the expected values with the observed values. The ttest is done for continuous vs continuous coulumns and the oneway test which is done for continuous vs category columns are evaluated successfully .

The chennai train dataset is analyed according to correleation theory and hypothesis theory and the result is evaluated successfully by comparing continuous vs continuous columns , continuous vs category columns , category vs category columns using two sample ttest ,oneway annova test and chi2 contigency test.
